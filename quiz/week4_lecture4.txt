CTR Modeling (1/1 point)
Why is CTR modeling crucial for online advertising?
1) Amount advertisers pay is often based on the effectiveness of the ad (e.g., obtaining a click or conversion), - correct
2) Publishers want to maximize the money they make hosting ads (hence want to
host ads with high CTR), - correct
3) 3rd party matchmakers need to make good matches to stay in business, - correct

Loss Functions (1/1 point)
What is the purpose of a loss function?
1) Itâ€™s a way to penalize a model for incorrect predictions, - correct
2) It precisely defines the optimization problem to be solved for a particular learning model, - correct
3) It creates new features for use in the model 

Convex Loss Functions (1/1 point)
Which of the following loss functions are convex?
1) Log-loss, - correct
2) 0 / 1 loss 

Logistic Regression with Regularization (1/1 point)
Select the true statements for logistic regression with regularization:
1) When lambda equals one, it provides the same result as standard logistic regression
2) Can be framed as minimizing a convex function, - correct
3) Closed-form solution exists 

The Logistic Function (1/1 point)
The logistic function 1 / (1 + exp^(-z)):
1) Has a probabilistic interpretation, - correct
2) Approaches 0 for large positive inputs
3) Returns values between 0 and 1, - correct

Classification Thresholds (1/1 point)
When using probabilistic predictions to classify, we should vary the threshold
based on the relative harm of false positives relative to false negatives.
1) True, - correct
2) False 

Spam Example (1/1 point)
In the spam example, if we use a threshold of 0 for spam classification, what percentage of emails will be classified as spam?
1) 0%
2) 50%
3) 100%, correct

Transforming Categorical Features (1/1 point)
Representing a categorical feature by a single numeric variable (with a variety of values) can introduce relationships / constraints that were non-existent prior to the transformation.
1) True, - correct
2) False 

Sparse Representations (1/1 point)
Using a sparse representation of our data can:
1) Save storage space, - correct
2) Reduce computational costs, - correct

Feature Collisions (1/1 point)
With feature hashing it is possible to hash different features to the same bucket.
1) True, - correct
2) False 

Feature hashing requires communication of intermediate results across nodes.
1) True
2) False, - correct
